# Maya
Maya is the lightest CSS framework, enabling simpler, more standards-compliant web design. No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS

## Getting started

There are a couple ways to download Skeleton:
- [Download the zip](https://github.com/agazinakou/Maya.git)
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/agazinakou/Maya.git` (Note: this is under active development, so if you're looking for stable and safe, use the zipped download)

### Why it's awesome

Maya is : 
- Just what you need
- Lightweight and simple
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework
- No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS

Nothing more.

## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. Maya works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.
